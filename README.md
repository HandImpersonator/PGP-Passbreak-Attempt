# PGP-Passbreak-Attempt
A reddit user messaged me on Reddit asking for some help related to PGP, he proposed a problem, gave me some constraints for the password and I attempted to help him as best I could, my curiosity was peaked with this sudden challenge...

## Password constraints
1. Alphabetic upper and lowercase
2. Shifted 10 (A > K)
3. English word

If the PGP Message and password constraints are correct, it *should* be able to decipher the message eventually according to the Reddit user.
